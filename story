Once upon a time, the was a man named Pavel,

He met Mark, the guy who seat behind hangout screen.

They worked together on a small project.

Which was a funny thing.

They kept running into problems with pull-requests.

But eventually they find out that fetching is good.

And that pulling is not always so good.

So they decide to play tennis.
